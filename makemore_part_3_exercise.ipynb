    "## The Problem: Character-Level Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Given a few characters from a name, predict the next character.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- Input: `\"emm\"` \u2192 Prediction: `\"a\"` (to spell \"emma\")\n",
    "- Input: `\"oli\"` \u2192 Prediction: `\"v\"` (to spell \"olivia\")\n",
    "- Input: `\"mia\"` \u2192 Prediction: `\".\"` (name ends)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is useful:**\n",
    "- Generate new names\n",
    "- Text completion\n",
    "- Understanding language structure\n",
    "- Foundation for more complex models (like GPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is good for learning initialization:**\n",
    "- Simple enough to understand completely\n",
    "- Complex enough to show real initialization problems\n",
    "- Fast to train (you'll see results quickly)\n",
    "- Easy to diagnose issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Connection to Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "At initialization (before any training), our neural network is like a newborn baby:\n",
    "- It knows nothing about names\n",
    "- It hasn't seen the patterns yet\n",
    "- It should make random, uniformguesses\n",
    "\n",
    "**If our network is very confident at initialization, that's a red flag!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "- **Good initialization:** \"I don't know what comes next, so I'll guess evenly among all possibilities\"\n",
    "- **Bad initialization:** \"I'm 99% sure the answer is 'q'!\" (but it's just guessing randomly)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad initialization is like a student who hasn't studied but answers every test question with 100% confidence. They'll be wrong a lot and get heavily penalized!\n",

    "   - During training, check if they're in good range",
    "   - If too large: initialization problem",
    "   - If drifting: might need batch norm",
    "",
    "3. **Check activation saturation**",
    "   - What % of neurons are saturated?",
    "   - Should be < 5% ideally",
    "   - If high: learning will be slow",
    "",
    "4. **This applies to ANY activation**",
    "   - sigmoid: same saturation issues",
    "   - ReLU: different issues (dead neurons)",

    "4. **Monitor throughout training** - don't just watch loss",
    "5. **Update ratios matter** - target 10\u207b\u00b3",
    "6. **Output layer is special** - use small random values",
    "7. **Biases usually zero** - let network learn them",
